## üëãüèª Welcome to my .dotfiles `rabbit hole`!

This is where I'm always tweaking and changing something to have my config feeling like home.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmarcelomb/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

## ‚ö° CLI Tools

Tools I currently use:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
- [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) - A terminal workspace with batteries included.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A `cat` clone with syntax highlighting.
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - A modern replacement for `ls`.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - A smarter `cd` command.
- [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) - Loads and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - A fast, user-friendly alternative to `find`.
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - A fast regex-based search tool.
- [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) - A terminal file manager written in Rust.
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - A cross-platform system monitor.
- [git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) - A syntax-highlighting pager for Git.
- [typos-cli](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) - A source code spell checker.
- [du-dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) - A more intuitive version of `du`.
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - A simple terminal UI for Git.

### Handy scripts:

- [copy](./scripts/copy) - Puts stdin in the OSC52 register.
- [paste](./scripts/paste) - Opens a text input for pasting.
- [lpaste](./scripts/lpaste) - Outputs the last text input from `paste`.
- [gen_commit_msg](./scripts/gen_commit_msg) - Uses local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or generate to standard output commit messages from `git diff`.

### Tools I'm keeping an eye on üëÄ:

- [television](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television)
- [skim](https://github.com/skim-rs/skim)
- [tabiew](https://github.com/shshemi/tabiew)
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)
- [gpg-tui](https://github.com/orhun/gpg-tui)

It is possible to install all current Rust tools via Cargo:

```sh
cargo install zellij \
              bat \
              eza \
              zoxide \
              fd-find \
              ripgrep \
              yazi-fm yazi-cli \
              bottom \
              git-delta \
              typos-cli \
              du-dust
```

### Alacritty

```sh
cargo install alacritty
```

### cargo-update

[cargo-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update) helps keep installed Rust tools up to date.

Install it via Cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-update
```

Update all installed Rust programs:

```sh
cargo install-update -a
```

### cargo-binstall

If you prefer not to compile Rust programs from source, [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) installs prebuilt binaries.

Example:

```sh
cargo binstall zellij
```

Install it via Cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

I'm still testing it out, but [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) could be a potential `lazygit` replacement, making it possible to install almost everything using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install gitui
```

## üíª Shell Setup

I currently use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and Bash/Zsh with the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt.

### How to set Fish as the Default Shell

```sh
echo $(which fish) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s $(which fish)
```

### Install Starship Prompt

Install [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for a modern, customizable shell prompt:

```sh
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```

### How to set Zsh as the Default Shell

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## ü¶Ä Rust Setup

Install Rust using Rustup:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

---

## üêç Python Setup

### Install `uv`

Use [uv](https://astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python virtual environments and projects:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or install via Cargo:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
```
